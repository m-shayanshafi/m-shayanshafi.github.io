Hi! I am a first-year Master's student in the [Networks, Systems and Security (NSS) lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/) at the [Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), where I am advised by [Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai).

My research interests lie in the area of privacy and security in distributed multi-party machine learning. More specifically, I am currently working on a system to train machine learning models collaboratively in a peer to peer setting while preserving privacy of an individual's data and defending the training process from poisoning attacks.  

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree from [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://sbasse.lums.edu.pk/department/computer-science) where I worked on developing an energy-efficient routing protocol for IOT devices and a design pattern retrieval system for software developers.   

Here's a link to my [resume](/files/resume.pdf).
