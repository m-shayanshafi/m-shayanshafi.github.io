We propose a layer 3 protocol that makes the use of ley-lines in order to ensure that the  state  that  is  required  to  be  stored  for  routing  is  constant  in  nodes  in  a  wireless sensor networks.  These nodes are known to be resource constrained in terms of memory and energy so existing routing protocols are insufficient since they exhibit linear or polynomial growth in their routing tables.  The LeyLine protocol  in  its  simplest  form  will  require  that  these  nodes  maintain  only  two routing entries, the previous and the next node on the line. The resulting stretch from storing such a limited amount of entries will be O(N), however, the protocol allows for additional entries to be stored in the forwarding tables.  These skip entries ensures that
a suitable tradeoff is achieved between routing state and stretch resulting in optimal energy consumption.
