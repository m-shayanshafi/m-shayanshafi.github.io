The task of writing documentation is often neglected due to the difficulties involved in maintaining it consistent with the underlying source code it represents. This creates a lack of information that
is conflicting with the obstacles faced by developers, especially when they are trying to understand unfamiliar codebases. Doco is an Atom plugin that uses techniques from static and
dynamic analysis in order to provide documentation in the form of pre- and post-conditions for functions in Java programs.
