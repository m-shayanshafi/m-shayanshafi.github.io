Centralized solutions for privacy-preserving multi-party ML are becoming increasingly infeasible. Google's Federated Learning is the current state of the art in supporting secure multi-party ML: data is maintained on the ownerâ€™s device and is aggregated through a secure protocol. However,
this process assumes a trusted centralized infrastructure to preserve privacy and is susceptible to poisoning attacks.As a response, we propose Biscotti: a fully decentralized P2P approach to multi-party ML, which leverages blockchain primitives to coordinate a privacy-preserving ML process between peering clients while protecting the performance of the global model at scale even when 48% of the adversaries are malicious.
