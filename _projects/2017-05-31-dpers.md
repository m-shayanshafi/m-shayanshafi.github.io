Software design patterns provide well-known solutions to recurring problems faced by developers. However, not all developers are proficient with the use of design patterns. To facilitate developers in this regard, we propose a design pattern usage examples retrieval system. The retrieval is based on analyzing the developer's development context to provide design pattern usage examples from projects that have a similar functional domain to that of the developer.
